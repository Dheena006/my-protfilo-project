        <p class="section-two__desc">Malala, a young Pakistani girl, grew up in the Swat Valley under Taliban rule. Girls were banned from going to school, but she loved learning and refused to stay silent. At just 11, she started writing a blog for the BBC under a pseudonym, describing life under the Taliban. When she was 15, she was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman for speaking out.

But that wasn't the end—it was a beginning. Malala recovered and became an international advocate for girls’ education. She won the Nobel Peace Prize at 17 and used her platform to help millions. Her journey is one of discovering strength, voice, and purpose under extreme pressure.

Lesson: Sometimes, knowing yourself comes from standing up for something you can’t live without.</p>
